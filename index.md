Hello everyone! My name is **Simon Liu** and I am a sophomore majoring in *Computer Science* at UCSD.

One of my life mottos is to live life with no regrets, which is why I love Wayne Gretzky's quote:

> You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

### Professional Experience

I started to learn about computer science in my senior year of high school, when I decided to take the class AP Computer Science. That made me feel like it was what I wanted to major in, which is why I decided to come to UCSD as a CS major. Additionally, I have had some experience as an intern, having the opportunity to intern at Northrop Grumman during my senior year summer as well as this past summer.

However, I haven't had the opportunity to interact with Git during my internship, so I had just recently learned about commands such as:
```
git branch
git commit
git push
```
